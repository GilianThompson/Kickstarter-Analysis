# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project is meant to analyize kickstarter data in order to help Louise create a successful crowdfunding campaign to fund her play. Initially, her budget is estimated to be over $10,000. 

This data set contains 4115 differnet kickstarters from different categories like theater and food whose outcome can be seen in the graph: 
![categoryOutcomes](desktop/categoryOutcomes.png). Next,  breakdown of the outcomes over the course of a year was done and can be seen in the following image: ![outcomesYear](desktop/outcomesYear.png).From these two charts, it looks like theater is an overall successful campaign with more success of achieving their campaign fundraising goal in May, June, and July. 

Some statisital analyis was also done on the data set. Filtering the data set to just plays, it was found that the average fundraising goal of successful campaigns for plays was approximately $5,049 with a standard deviation being $7,749. These successful campaigns had an average pledged amount of $5,602 with a standard deviation of $8,335 compared to the failed campaigns whose average goal was $10,554 with a standard deviation of $21,968 but were only able to pledge an average of $559 with a standard deviation of $1,331. The goals of the failed play campaigns  were significantly higher than the goals of the successful play campaigns, averaging at $5,049. Based on this, it is recommended that Louise attempt to lower her campaign goal to more resemble those of successful play campaigns. 

Some analysis was also done on theather campaigns in Great Britain where Louise plans to hold a future campaign for a musical with an estimated budget of $4,000. It was observed that these types of campaigns are also generally successful, although the median goal for the data set was approximately $2,000 which approximately 75% of the pledged amounts were equal to or less than. So, it is recommended that Louise lower her budget for her future campaign in Great Britain, too.
